# ðŸš€ Next.js Learning Project

This is a **learning project** where I studied Next.js using pre-built templates and examples. I didn't write nor build this project - it's all pre-styled templates that I used to learn Next.js concepts.

## ðŸŽ¯ What I Learned

### 1. **CSS Styling (Modules)**
- CSS Modules for component-scoped styling
- Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Responsive design principles

### 2. **Font & Image Optimization**
- `next/font/google` for Google Fonts integration
- `next/image` for automatic image optimization
- Font preloading and subsetting
- Responsive images with proper dimensions

### 3. **Layout & Pages**
- App Router structure and organization
- Nested layouts with `layout.tsx`
- Route groups and organization

### 4. **Navigation Between Pages**
- `Link` component for client-side navigation
- Dynamic routing with `[id]` segments
- Programmatic navigation with `redirect()`

### 5. **Data Fetching & Database**
- Server-side data fetching
- PostgreSQL integration with Postgres.js
- Database seeding and sample data

### 6. **Static & Dynamic Rendering**
- Static generation for performance
- Dynamic rendering for real-time data
- Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

### 7. **Streaming & Loading Skeletons**
- Suspense boundaries for progressive loading
- Skeleton components for better UX
- Streaming data with fallbacks

### 8. **Partial Rendering**
- Component-level loading states
- Parallel data fetching
- Optimistic updates

### 9. **Search & Pagination (Next.js APIs)**
- Search functionality implementation
- Pagination controls
- URL-based state management

### 10. **Server Actions (Data Mutations)**
- `"use server"` directive
- Form handling with server actions
- Database mutations and revalidation
- `revalidatePath()` for cache invalidation

### 11. **Error Handling**
- `error.tsx` boundary components
- Try-catch error handling
- User-friendly error messages

### 12. **Server & Client Components**
- React Server Components vs Client Components
- Form validation on both sides
- Component boundary decisions

### 13. **NextAuth Integration**
- Authentication with NextAuth.js
- Protected routes and middleware
- Server actions with authentication

## ðŸ›  Technology Stack Used

- **Next.js 15** - React framework with App Router
- **React 19** - Latest React features
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS
- **PostgreSQL** - Database
- **NextAuth.js** - Authentication

## ðŸŽ“ Project Purpose

This project serves as a hands-on learning experience for Next.js concepts. All the styling, components, and structure were pre-built - I focused on understanding how everything works together and implementing the learning concepts.
